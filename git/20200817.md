# Done

1. Algorithms : Greedy strategy
- Coin problem, knapsack problem
- with constraints, when we can apply ascendance or descendance to the problem, we can use greedy strategy. but, Greedy strategy cannot guarantee the best answer. It can only approximate the best answer.

2. Mathematics for machine learning
- Probability and Distributions

3. Deep learning basic
- Mathematical understanding of Shallow Neural Network
    - neuron process(affine function, activation function)
    - fully-connected layer
    - Input layer, hidden layer, output layer
    - MSE, Log-loss(Cross entropy error), Categorical Log-loss
    - sparse vector, soft-max function, sigmoid function

4. Mathematics for deep learning
- review "SVLR(Single Variate Linear Regression)"
    - what is linear regression, regression?
    - Loss, cost function
    - gradient descent method
    - learning rate
    - parameter update change according to the learning rate, input size
    - the effect of noise to learning process
    - overall learning process(forward propagation(loss and cost calculation) - backpropagation(parameter update))
    - hyperparameter tuning(learning-rate, the number of epoch, initial parameter, mini-batch size
    - vectorization of node for several samples
    - effect of cost node : pooling effect or 1/n distribution effect to the loss of each data point
