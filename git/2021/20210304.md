# Done

1. NLP
- text preprocessing
    - research trends in nlp(rule-based -> statistical -> machine learning, end-to-end)
    - lexical analysis
        - sentence splitting
        - tokenizing
        - morphological analysis(stemming, lemmatization)
        - POS tagging
        - Named Entity Recognition
        - etc

    - syntax analysis
        - parser algorithm(directionality, search strategy)
        - multiple parsing tree because of language ambiguity(lexical ambiguity, sturctural ambiguity)
    - language modeling
