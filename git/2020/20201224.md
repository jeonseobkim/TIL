# Done

1. Mathematical Deep learning
    - feedforward, backpropagation in linear regression with no bias form
    - relationship between parameter update and learning rate, size of input
    - the effect of mini batch
    - loss function, cost function
    - gradient descent

2. linear algebra
    - LU decomposition
    - orthogonal matrix and subspace

3. deeplearning from scratch
