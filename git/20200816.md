# Done

1. Mathematics for deep_learning : Vectorization, Jacobians, mini-batch
2. deep_learning_basic : brief history of deep_learning, shallow neural network
- Activation function
    - regression : identity function
    - binary classification : sigmoid function
    - multi-class classification : softmax function

3. Linux
- understand system
    - Linux controls all resources in file-systems
    - Linux process : ELF format, pid based classification, init process base - fork()
    - etc.

4. Graph neural network 
- graph : set of Vertex(vertices) and Edge
- representation of "graph" in computer
    - Adjacency matrix : represent connectivity between vertices
    - Feature matrix : represent features of vertex

# Todo

1. English
2. Graph theory introduction
